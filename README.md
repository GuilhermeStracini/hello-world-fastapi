# Hello World FastAPI (Python)

ðŸ“š A repository to learn and explore the basics of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

---

## Overview

This repository serves as an educational resource to:

- Understand the foundational structure of a **FastAPI** application.
- Experiment with creating routes, handling requests, and managing responses.
- Learn how FastAPI leverages Python's type hints for auto-generated documentation and validation.

## Features

- **Hello World Application**:
  - Demonstrates the basic setup of a FastAPI project.
  - Includes a simple endpoint to get started.

- **Beginner-Friendly**:
  - Aimed at developers new to FastAPI and modern Python web development.
  - Provides a solid starting point for more advanced FastAPI projects.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher.
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or a similar virtual environment tool is recommended.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GuilhermeStracini/hello-world-fastapi.git
   cd hello-world-fastapi
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

4. **Access the API**:
